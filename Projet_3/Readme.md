# Challenge 3 

In this challenge, a smart house system is controlled using computer vision based on hand gesture recognition. Three specific hand symbols are used to trigger different actions:

- Symbol 1 controls the house door, which operated by a DC motor.
- Symbol 2 controls the parking gate, man- aged by a servo motor.
- Symbol 3 turns on a LED light.

The system uses a camera to detect and in- terpret the hand gestures in real time, ena- bling contactless control of key smart home components.
