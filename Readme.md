# Innospeed 3.0 

This repo contains our work during this hackathon . 

Our Team DagDeg (me , Aziz Harzalah , Aberrazek Boussaid and Karim Zitouna) secured 2 place 

In just 24 hours, we tackled five unique challenges and successfully completed them all in record time.

Each challenge required us to develop a complete solution, starting with programming and system design, followed by a live presentation to the judges for validation. Once approved, we moved on to the hardware implementation, aiming for fully functional end-to-end solutions.

The challenges spanned multiple domains, including:
- Computer Vision
- Embedded Systems
- IoT (Internet of Things)
- General Problem Solving
